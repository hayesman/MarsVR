# MarsVR

These tools were written by Eric Hayes as part of the Mars VR Experience, an immersive reconstruction of the Mars surface made using images from NASA's Curiosity rover and photogrammetry.  The experience is a prototype for astronaut training and mission operations applications.

The Unreal project, reconstructed 3D models, and project files are available here:
